# Example App, Module and Connection

You can find the example projects in the documentation repo under `examples`:
[https://github.com/NexusSwitchboard/docs/tree/master/examples](https://github.com/NexusSwitchboard/docs/tree/master/examples)

You can find an example of an app, connection and module and the relationship between all three.  They have been simplified for the purposes of edification.  The app uses the example module and the example module uses the example connection. 

In all cases, there is no expectation that anything has been published to NPM - a local connection and module are used.
