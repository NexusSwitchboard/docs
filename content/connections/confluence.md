# Nexus - Confluence Connection

[![Github](../../assets/images/GitHub-Mark-32px.png)](https://github.com/NexusSwitchboard/nexus-conn-confluence/)

The Confluence connection is a thin wrapper around an API client written in Typescript that is [available here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-confluence-client).   

An instance of the API client is exposed through the `api` property on the connection instance.
