# What is Nexus

Nexus is a framework written in typescript that helps to establish _connections_ between third-party services through  _modules_ which provide business logic to transform inputs and outputs from/to the connections.

A Nexus-based application uses Nexus to load and configure these modules and connections through the use of the nexus-core package. Nexus can be thought of as more of a *standard* than a framework in that it exposes interfaces that allows people to re-use connections and modules that others have written.  With a library of connections to third-parties, they will be able to quickly get access to third party services with little ramp up allowing them to focus more on the business logic.  

And, in the case where a module already exists that does what they need to do, they can simply use that module and get up and running through configuration changes.
